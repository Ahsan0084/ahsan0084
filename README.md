## 🚀 About Me

<!-- ```python
class AhsanAli:
    def __init__(self):
        self.role = "Lead R&D Engineer @ The Disrupt Labs"
        self.education = "Electrical Engineer (Electronics)"
        self.experience = "4+ years"

        return "Building IoT projects for freelance clients & filming cars at motorsport events"
``` -->

I'm a self-driven Electrical Engineer with 4+ years of experience who loves making computers see, think, and move! Currently serving as the **Lead R&D Engineer** at [**The Disrupt Labs**](https://thedisruptlabs.com/), where I lead end-to-end R&D projects involving design and implementation of classical & deep learning based **computer vision** systems and **robotics** based solutions.

**By day** → Building systems that automate quality inspection compliance through AI & computer vision                   
**By night** → Working on IoT & embedded systems projects for freelance clients  
**On weekends** → You'll most probably find me travelling or covering an offroad rally or a motorsports event

## 🏎️ Motorsports & Creative Side

When I'm not building AI systems or tinkering with embedded projects, you'll find me at **off-road rallies** and **autocross events** across Pakistan!

I've worked part-time as a **Race Data and Timing Engineer**, providing real-time data monitoring and technical support for major motorsport events. There's something magical about combining my engineering skills with my passion for motorsports 🏁

I also love **filming cars** — capturing the raw energy and beauty of these machines in motion. It's my creative side that keeps my passion for cars and motorsports alive!
